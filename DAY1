JAVA SCRIPT is interpreted based language.
JAVA SCRIPT is  Case sensitive.

For printing the statements on the window the javascript  uses
Console.log("javascript");

COMMENTS:
There are two ways of comments
	1. Single line comments
	2. Multi line comments

SINGLE LINE COMMENTS - // It is an One line Comment
MULTI LINE COMMENTS-/*this is an
                                              *multiline comment
                                              */

DECLARATIONS:
There are three types of Declarations in Java Script
1.let
2.var
3.const

var:
Variables with var can be redeclared.
Variables with var have block scope.
There are two types
1.Local Variable: The variables are accessed to only inside the function.
Example:
function lv(){  
var x=10;//local variable  
}  

2.Global Variable: The variables are accessed to whole program.
Example:
var data=200;//global variable  
function a(){  
Console.log(data);  
}  

let:
Variables defined with let cannot be redeclared.
Variables defined with let have block scope.
Example:
{
let a =20;
}

const:
Variables defined with const cannot be redeclared.
Variables defined with const cannot be reassigned.
Variables defined with const have block scope.
Example:
const PI = 3.14159265359;

DATA TYPES:
Java script has 8 data types:
1.string
2.number
3.bigint
4.boolean
5.undefined
6.null
7.symbol
8.object
Object contains
Array, object, date

OPERATORS:
These are the following types of operators in java script
1.Arithmetic operation  : +,-,*,/,%
2.Relational operators   : ==,===,!=,!==,>,<,>=,<=
3.Bitwise operators        : &,|,^,~,<<,>>
4.Logical Operators        : &&,||,!
5.Assignment operators: =,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=

JAVA SCRIPT if - else:

The JavaScript if-else statement is used to execute the code whether condition is true or false. There are three forms of if statement in JavaScript.
	1. If Statement:
	Syntax: 
	if(expression){  
	      //content to be evaluated 
	}  
	2. If else statement:
	Syntax:
	if(expression){  
	      //content to be evaluated if condition is true  
	}  
	else{  
	     //content to be evaluated if condition is false  
	}  
	3. if else if statement
            Syntax:
           if(expression1){  
                   //content to be evaluated if expression1 is true  
            }  
           else if(expression2){  
                  //content to be evaluated if expression2 is true  
            }  
           else if(expression3){  
                  //content to be evaluated if expression3 is true  
           }  
           else{  
                  //content to be evaluated if no expression is true  
            }  
SWITCH:
The JavaScript switch statement is used to execute one code from multiple expressions. It is just like else if statement that we have learned in previous page. But it is convenient than if..else..if because it can be used with numbers, characters etc.
switch(expression){  
case value1:  
 code to be executed;  
 break;  
case value2:  
 code to be executed;  
 break;  
......  
  
default:   
 code to be executed if above values are not matched;  
}  

LOOPS:
1.for
2.while
3.do while

for loop:
Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment)  
{  
    code to be executed  
}  

while loop:
Syntax:
while (condition)  
{  
    code to be executed  
} 

do while loop:
Syntax:
do{  
    code to be executed  
}while (condition);
